                                Internet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem of connected physical objects that are accessible through the internet. The thing in IoT could be a person with a heart monitor or an automobile with built-in-sensors, i.e. objects that have been assigned an IP address and have the ability to collect and transfer data over a network without manual assistance or intervention. The embedded technology in the objects helps them to interact with internal states or the external environment, which in turn affects the decisions taken.

Devices and objects with built in sensors are connected to an Internet of Things platform, which integrates data from the different devices and applies analytics to share the most valuable information with applications built to address specific needs.

These powerful IoT platforms can pinpoint exactly what information is useful and what can safely be ignored. This information can be used to detect patterns, make recommendations, and detect possible problems before they occur.

For example, if I own a car manufacturing business, I might want to know which optional components (leather seats or alloy wheels, for example) are the most popular. Using Internet of Things technology, I can:

Use sensors to detect which areas in a showroom are the most popular, and where customers linger longest;
Drill down into the available sales data to identify which components are selling fastest;
Automatically align sales data with supply, so that popular items dont go out of stock.
The information picked up by connected devices enables me to make smart decisions about which components to stock up on, based on real-time information, which helps me save time and money.

With the insight provided by advanced analytics comes the power to make processes more efficient. Smart objects and systems mean you can automate certain tasks, particularly when these are repetitive, mundane, time-consuming or even dangerous. Lets look at some examples to see what this looks like in real life.

                            <li><p><b>Smart Homes</b> Home automation or domotics is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems.</p></li>
                            <li><p><b>Wearables</b> Wearable technology is a hallmark of the Internet of Things and the most ubiquitous of its implementations to date. The efficiency of data processing achieved by various smart wristwear, smart clothes, and medical wearables is getting to the point where this consumer-oriented side of the IoT technology will bring exceptional value to our lives and become a new fashion along the way.</p></li>
                            <li><p><b>Smart City</b> A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community </p></li>
                            <li><p><b>Smart Grid</b> A smart grid is an electrical grid which includes a variety of operational and energy measures including smart meters, smart appliances, renewable energy resources, and energy efficient resources</p</li>
                            <li><p><b>Industrial Internet</b> The Industrial Internet is the integration and linking of big data, analytical tools and wireless networks with physical and industrial equipment, or otherwise applying meta-level networking functions, to distributed systems.</p></li>
                            <li><p><b>Connected Car</b> Today's typical car is a marvel of connectivity — the world’s most technologically advanced consumer product and a key part of the Internet of Things. There is already an extensive local Internet within each vehicle, with more than 50 microcomputers containing 100 million lines of code networked with each other and dozens of sensors and actuators. Together, these systems of connected car technology help to control the engine and brakes, and monitor the tire pressure and exhaust gas composition, among many other things.</p></li>
