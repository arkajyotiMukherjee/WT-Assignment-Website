                                Big data is a term used to refer to the study and applications of data sets that are so big and complex that traditional data-processing application software are inadequate to deal with them. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source company's problem at hand if the company has sufficient technical capabilities.
								<P>Data sets grow rapidly because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices such as mobile devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;
								as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5Ã—1018) of data are generated. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.

                                Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that <strong> Software AG, Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP, Dell </strong> have spent more than $15 billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100 billion and was growing at almost 10 percent a year: about twice as fast as the software business as a whole. <p> Developed economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies.<B>There are 4.6 billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1 billion and 2 billion people accessing the internet.</B>

                                Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1 billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 exabytes in 2007 and predictions put he amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014. According to one estimate, one-third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data,which is the format most useful for most big data applications.

                                  <p> This also shows the potential of yet unused data <STRIKE>(i.e. in the form of video and audio content)</STRIKE>.While many vendors offer off-the-shelf solutions for big data, experts recommend the development of in-house solutions custom-tailored to solve the company's problem at hand if the company has sufficient technical capabilities. Research on the effective usage of <I> information and communication technologies for development </I>(also known as ICT4D) suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to International development.
								 <U>Advancements in big data analysis offer cost-effective opportunities to improve decision-making in critical development areas</U> such as health care, employment, economic productivity, crime, security, and natural disaster and resource management. Additionally, user-generated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice.However, longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy,imperfect methodology, and interoperability issues.
